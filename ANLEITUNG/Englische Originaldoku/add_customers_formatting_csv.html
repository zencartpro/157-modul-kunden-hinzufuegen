  <p>If you don't know how to make a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, then use Microsoft Excel as normal to create a spreadsheet sheet. When you are ready to save, choose <span class="style1">file>save as</span> then at the bottom there will be a 'Save as type' option; choose 'CSV (comma delimited)' and then press Save. Answer yes to any warnings and there you have it... a csv!</p>
